Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the systematic application of ngineering principles,methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.
Importance of software engineering is that it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life e.g communication.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.The development of programming languages.
2.The advent of structured programming in the 1970s.
3.The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements.
   Gather user needs and system requirements.
2. Design
    Come up with a detailed design of the software architecture and user interface.
3.Implementation.
   Writing code and building the software according to the specified design.
4.Testing.
   To ensure software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5.Deployment.
   Releasing the software
6.Maintenance.
   Providing support and enhancements after deployment.
   
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology involves a sequential approach with distinct phases of the SDLC stages flowing downwards like a waterfall,for example,  in developing a government system where all the requirements are defined upfront and unlikely to change,while the agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility,collaboration and responding to change,for example ,a startup developing a mobile app where user feedback and market conditions necessitate frequent changes.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Developer : Writing code and implementing software solutions.
2. Quality assurance engineer : Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
3. Project Manager : Oversees the planning,execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1.Intergrated Development Environments.
  Provide comprehensive tools for writing,testing and debugging code e.g Visual studio code
2.Version Control Systems.
 Tracks changes to source code and coordinates work among team members e.g Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1.Changing requirements
2.Tight deadlines
3.Technical debt

Strategies include:effective communication, agile methodologies,prioritization of tasks and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit testing : Testing individual componenets or modules of software.
2. Integration testing : Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
3. System testing : Testing the entire software
4. Acceptance testing : Testing the software againt user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is about crafting your questions or instructions in a way that helps get the best responses from your robot or AI assistant.It enables you to get the best responses from AI.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt : Tell me about sandwitches.
Improved prompt : Give me a step-by-step recipe for making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

itâ€™s clear and specific, helping the robot (or an AI) give you the best answer quickly.
